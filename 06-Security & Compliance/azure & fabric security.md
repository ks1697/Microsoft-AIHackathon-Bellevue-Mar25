# 🔹 Part 2: Microsoft Fabric Security - Protecting Data in the Lakehouse  

## 🎯 Understanding Fabric Security Principles  

📌 **Fabric Security Covers:**  

✔ **Authentication** – Microsoft Entra ID (**formerly Azure AD**).  
✔ **Authorization** – Role-based access to **workspaces & data**.  
✔ **Data Protection** – **Encryption at rest & in transit**.  
✔ **Network Security** – **Private endpoints & firewalls**.  

---

## 🎯 Secure Your Fabric Lakehouse Dataflows  

📌 **Protecting Data in OneLake & Fabric Workspaces**  

### ✅ Control Access via Workspaces  
- Assign **Contributor, Admin, or Viewer** roles to **limit data access**.  

### ✅ Use Private Endpoints for Secure Connectivity  
- Restrict access to **trusted networks**.  

### ✅ Enable Managed Private Endpoints  
- This **prevents unauthorized data movement** to **untrusted locations**.  

### ✅ Apply Row-Level & Column-Level Security  
- Restrict **data visibility** based on **user roles & permissions**.  

### ✅ Monitor Data Activity with Fabric Security Logs  
- **Set up alerts** for **suspicious activities** in **Microsoft Defender**.

> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
